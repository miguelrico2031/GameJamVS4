  - Speaker: 0
    Text: Just a little dose of happiness for our subject. Also known as 3,4-dihydroxyphenethylamine
      or dopamine, are you familiar with it?.
  - Speaker: 1
    Text: Yes i know what dopamine is but, is it good for the rat to receive so many
      doses on such small intervals?
  - Speaker: 0
    Text: It's all part of the experiment. You see, we want to understand how external
      stimuli influence the rat's behavior, and a little chemical motivation aids
      our cause.
  - Speaker: 0
    Text: Besides, the rat loves it, doesn't it? Now, let's not get hung up on useless
      ethics debates. We have more trials ahead. Get ready.
