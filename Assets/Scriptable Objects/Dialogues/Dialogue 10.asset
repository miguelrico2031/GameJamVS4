    Text: The doctor is about to arrive, but I wanted to tell you that I'm going
      to help you escape. You have to be the one to escape, so the doctor doesn't
      think I've helped you. In this experiment, instead of pressing the button,
      stay still, and when you see the opportunity, escape.

    Text: Squeak seems filled with determination to break free from their chains.
      Just by looking at them, anyone can understand that it would be impossible
      to stand in Squeak's way to freedom.
