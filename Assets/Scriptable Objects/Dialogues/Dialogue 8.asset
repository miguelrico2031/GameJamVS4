    Text: Doctor, I think you should give me an explanation. I don't understand the
      purpose and cruelty of these experiments...

    Text: Oh, so you demand an explanation? Well, I'll give you one. One day I was
      at the park, enjoying a sandwich. Not just any sandwich, a really good one,
      from my favorite sandwich shop. Suddenly, a rat came along, jumped on me, stole
      my sandwich, and ran off.

    Text: I chased the rat through the park, but it slipped into its burrow. The
      next day, I went back to the same shop for another sandwich, only to find it
      had closed permanently.
  - Speaker: 0
    Text: That destroyed me inside. I went back to the rat's burrow seeking revenge,
      and while I didn't find her, I found her offspring. She took what I cherished
      the most, so I did the same. And if I can use her offspring for experiments,
      even better.

    Text: If you have any issues, find another internship, but if you dare to set
      her free, I'll make sure you're expelled from the university.

    Text: Understood, doctor...
